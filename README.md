# Second Hand Car Sales in Malta
## Facebook Marketplace

Scraping exercise of Facebook Marketplace listings in Malta for second hand cars. Scraping was done in several small batches over a period of a few days at the end of April and the first day of May 2023. The use of irregular small batches of scraping were used given that Facebook tends to slow down performance when it starts to detect automated scraping. The security protocols for detection in the scraping code put in place stop scraping when web page performace becomes excessively slow, and allows for repeated scraping without the detetction and closure of Facebook accounts.

Data analysis centred around car prices, condition, transmission, and fuel type.
